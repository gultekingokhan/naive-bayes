# Naive-Bayes

A supervised machine learning algorithm based on possibilities.

## Why it is called 'Naive'?

Naive Bayes is called “Naive” because it knows the frequency of usage of the words, not word order. 

## Classifying texts
One particular feature of Naive Bayes is that it’s a good algorithm for working with text classification. When dealing with text, it’s very common to treat each unique word as a feature, and since the typical person’s vocabulary is many thousands of words, this makes for a large number of features. The relative simplicity of the algorithm and the independent features assumption of Naive Bayes make it a strong performer for classifying texts.

## Pros & Cons of Naive-Bayes

### Pros
- Easy to implement.
- Simple to run, it’s efficient.

### Cons
- Phrases in multiple words like “Chicago Bulls” doesn’t work,
